## Update!

Thanks to @huderlem, now this viewer supports both KDL1 and KDL2. To prevent link breaking, the project will continue to be called `kdl2viewer`, but has been updated in several places to mention it supports KDL1 now.

----

See document.org for the entire rundown of KDL2 level format.

Or go to http://lf94.github.io/kdl2viewer/ to try it for both KDL1 and KDL2!
